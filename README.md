# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About 

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What do we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket.
The ticket fees will go to the winner during the draw.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner. 
This will be done progamatically.
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink automation. 
Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
